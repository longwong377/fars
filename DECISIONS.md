# DECISIONS (decision · alternatives · evidence · reversible?)

## D-001 Engine stack (Phase 0, provisional until Phase 1 benchmarks)
- **Three.js r186 WebGPURenderer + TSL**, automatic WebGL2 backend fallback (`forceWebGL` for the separate test path).
  Alt: Babylon.js (brief mandates Three.js). Evidence: both paths verified available in headless Chromium (PREFLIGHT.md).
- **TypeScript + Vite**; tests: **Vitest** (unit/dimension/sky/weather/soak) + **Playwright** (camera rig, walkthrough bots, bench).
- **Sky/ephemeris: astronomy-engine** (MIT; VSOP87 truncated + ΔT model of Espenak–Meeus; supports dates back to −2000s,
  proleptic Julian handling via our own calendar layer). Alt: hand-rolled Meeus (more error-prone), JPL Horizons (blocked, B2).
- **Physics: Rapier (`@dimforge/rapier3d-compat`)** for character controller (step-up, slopes, falls). Alt: custom capsule vs BVH
  (three-mesh-bvh) — kept as fallback if WASM init fails in tests.
- **Navigation: recast-navigation-js** (Recast/Detour WASM, crowd). Alt: grid A* (C-tier fallback for sim-LOD agents).
- **Randomness: one seeded PRNG tree** (sfc32 streams derived from WORLD_SEED + subsystem name) — deterministic tests.
- **Fonts: @fontsource Noto Sans Old Persian / Cuneiform / Imperial Aramaic** (OFL).

## D-002 Georeference and world frame (revised in Phase 0/1; review MJ-6)
- **Grid frame:** the origin is the Apadana OSM centroid (29.9351174 N, 52.8894969 E). The axes follow the Persepolis building grid: grid north = 341° true, i.e. rotated 19° W of true north.
- **World frame:** +X = grid east, +Y = up, −Z = grid north. Heights are metres relative to the court datum (1625.0 m asl, EGM2008 geoid, the Copernicus vertical datum).
- **Data processing:** a transverse Mercator centred on the origin, then rotated −19° (tools/osm_to_grid.py, tools/build_terrain.py). The browser uses an ellipsoidal tangent-plane approximation (src/core/geo.ts), tested against the pyproj-derived control to under 3 m.
- The earlier UTM/ENU plan was superseded by the rotated grid so that the architecture is axis-aligned.

## D-003 YEAR = 467 BCE (Xerxes I regnal year 19; astronomical year −466). Default start: 1 Nisannu = 17 April 467 BCE (proleptic Julian), JDN 1550958
**Alternatives:**
- 498 BCE (Darius I yr 24): the Fortification Archive peak, recommended by research subagent C (`research/_date_decision_C.md`).
- 466 BCE: the other Treasury peak year.

**Why 467:**
1. §3 priority 4 and Phase 3 require the route plain → Grand Stairway → **Gate of All Nations** → Apadana. The Gate of All Nations is Xerxes' (XPa, tier A), so it did not exist in 498. The Grand Stairway's builder is disputed (Darius vs Xerxes), so it too may be absent in 498. The 498 date would break the brief's core route.
2. "Height of its glory": the Apadana (completed by Xerxes), Tachara (completed, XPc), Hadish, Gate of All Nations, Harem and final Treasury all stand (tier A/B).
3. Construction is an asset: the Hall of a Hundred Columns is a live building site (begun by Xerxes, finished by Artaxerxes I; tier B).
4. The Treasury Archive peaks in Xerxes yrs 19–20 (Iranica, via extract; B), so this is the best-documented year of the Treasury period for named people. Examples are the treasurer Baratkama and the Treasury workmen paid partly in silver.

**Cost, accepted and logged:** far fewer named people than 498 (128 of 753 Treasury tablets published vs 2,120+ PF texts). The Fortification-era individuals named in brief §4.4 do not appear in person: Parnakka died c. 497/6, and Irdabama and Irtašduna are Darius-era. Irtašduna may still be alive (C). Earlier PF names may be reused only for *unnamed* NPC names, never as the same person (§9.1).

**Default start:** 1 Nisannu yr 19 falls in spring. It is 17 Apr 467 BCE per Parker & Dubberstein, via the machine-readable transcription seanredmond/parker_and_dubberstein (row `1550958 -466 4 17 1 Nisanu 30`), tier A for the Babylonian calendar. It is tier B for its Persian equivalence: Adukanaiša ≈ Nisannu. Year 19 has 12 months. The intercalary Addaru II (18 Mar 467) closes Xerxes year 18, so the regnal year runs 17 Apr 467 – 5 Apr 466 (354 days). (Corrected after the Phase 0 review, M-9.)

**Court presence (revised after Phase 0 review C-1).** No source places Xerxes at Persepolis on any date in 467 BCE (Q-005). The brief (§2) says the king is present only on dates the evidence supports. So:
- **Default (evidence-strict): the king is ABSENT all year.** A reduced garrison keeps watch, especially on the Treasury (§9.1). The world shows the absence: the Apadana is closed, the court tents are struck, and the Terrace is a working building site and treasury.
- The out-of-world setting **Court calendar = "seasonal pattern"** (tier C) models the B-tier general pattern: Persepolis as a spring/summer residence of a mobile court (WP-PERS-SEASON, RESIDENCE2021), with New Year court traffic (KING2022, Darius period). In that mode the court is in residence from 1 Nisannu to the end of Du'uzu. The §1.1 "court in full assembly" camera scene uses this mode and is labelled C.
- Conflict with brief §0 ("court in residence") is logged in BLOCKERS B9: §2's evidence rule wins by default.
- The default start date stays at 1 Nisannu: it is the start of the regnal year and the New Year. No date in 467 is better evidenced, so moving the start would not satisfy "evidence places the court" either.

**Why 467, not 466 (the other Treasury peak year):** this is a tie-break, not an evidence-based choice (corrected after re-review M-9). Both years are Treasury peak years, both lie before Xerxes' murder (465), and neither has evidence of court presence. 467 was taken as the first of the two peak years. Named Treasury individuals (e.g. Baratkama) are **not yet** shown to be attested in year 19 specifically; that is checked in Phase 5 before any named person is placed.

**Early Artaxerxes I years (464–458):** rejected. The Hall of 100 Columns would be further along (B), but the Treasury tablets thin out (a few per year to year 7), the king's presence is equally unevidenced, and the new reign's building programme (Palace H) is unknown in extent.

## D-004 Climate target
WMO CLINO 1991–2020 Shiraz 40848 (tier A, modern). Persepolis adjustment: Tmean and Tmin −1.5 °C, Tmax −1.0 °C, precipitation unchanged (tier C; lapse rate plus the Zarghan comparison). No paleoclimate temperature correction is applied (none sourced). A precipitation multiplier of 1.0 applies, with at most +10% as a C tunable (Maharlou cores: wet 3800–2000 BP; B). Modern dust and haze day counts are scaled ×0.5 for pre-modern (C) because modern pollution is excluded.

## D-005 Weather generator calibration (§13.6 interpretation)
- The gate "a simulated year's monthly mean temperatures within ±1 °C" is tested on the WORLD_SEED=1 year and, for robustness, on 10 more seeds.
- Precipitation-day counts are tested two ways: the annual count of the simulated year against the climate target, and a 50-year monthly climatology for months with ≥3 wet days. Both must be within ±20%.
- To keep a single year inside these tolerances while keeping realistic day-to-day variability, monthly means and wet-day counts are re-centred toward the normals. 35% of each month's sampled anomaly is kept, which corresponds to interannual variability of about 1 °C (C).

## D-006 Terrain pipeline
- Rings, in the grid frame: near 4 km at 4 m, mid 16 km at 16 m, far 82 km at 80 m. Storage is Uint16 quantised to 1–3 cm.
- Bare-earth approximation: an alternating grey opening/closing (r = 110 m) plus Gaussian smoothing, applied where the 150 m-smoothed regional slope is below 3–6%. This removes trees, buildings, the 1971 tent city, canals and embankments from the plain, and keeps the mountain (C).
- Terrace foot: Laplace infill in a 90 m band on the W, N and S sides. Under the platform the height is held at plain level during the infill, so no DSM smear leaks out. The platform itself is geometry.
- Ancient ground level: modern bare-earth, with no correction (Q-003).

## D-007 Render-path compatibility (measured in the sandbox)
- **Headless WebGPU** needs `--use-vulkan=swiftshader`. Without it, even a raw WebGPU clear loses its device ("A valid external Instance reference no longer exists"). Flags are in playwright.config.ts.
- **three r186** sets `swizzle:'rgba'` on texture views, which Chromium 141 rejects. `src/render/compat.ts` retries without the field. It does nothing on newer browsers.
- **Reversed-Z** is used on WebGPU. SkyMesh pins depth to 1.0, which is the *near* plane under reversed-Z, so the sky, moon and stars are drawn first without depth testing. The WebGL2 fallback cannot use reversed-Z without clip control, so it uses a logarithmic depth buffer.
- **PCFSoftShadowMap** was removed in r186 WebGPU; PCF is used instead. Soft and contact-hardening shadows are Phase 3 work (§8).

## D-008 Phase 1 subsystem choices (benchmarked where the sandbox can measure)
- **Terrain:** CPU-built chunk LOD with skirts, three rings. GPU displacement (brief example) is deferred: the CPU chunks already cost < 1.2 M triangles and 99 draws at the approach view, and a geomorph/clipmap version is a Phase 9 optimisation (logged).
- **Repeated architecture elements:** InstancedMesh per element type per building. Static walls are merged per building. SwiftShader cannot show draw-call cost (REAL_HARDWARE_TODO H2), so the choice rests on standard GPU practice (B).
- **Shadows:** a single 4k directional map following the player (high); CSM arrives in Phase 3. Shadow cost doubles SwiftShader frame time (H3).
- **Physics:** Rapier heightfield per ring plus trimesh per building. The character controller has autostep 0.4 m and snap 0.35 m, verified by vitest (walk speed, grounding, collider orientation vs render heightfield).
- **Bots and soak:** use `simulate(seconds, dt)`, a fixed-step simulation without rendering, so results don't depend on software-renderer speed.

## D-009 Review phase1-2 responses
- **MJ-1:** every generator dimension is now a SITE_SPEC row. Reconstruction choices are `r_*` rows (tier C, each with a note). A test fails if a numeric literal other than structural constants appears in src/arch/terrace.ts.
- **MJ-2:** the Apadana N and E stairs now attach to the podium's measured edge at the stair span, and landings no longer contain steps (tested).
- **MJ-3 / MJ-4:** PROGRESS wording is corrected. An independent SRTM-derived elevation check has been added (tests/data/srtm_points.json).
- **MJ-5:** the save/load round trip is now asserted in e2e. A save made with a different seed reloads the world with that seed.
- **MJ-6:** `npm run bench` exists (tests/e2e/bench.spec.ts, writing bench-reports/). D-002 now describes the actual rotated grid frame.
- **GTAO** fails shader compilation under SwiftShader, so the medium profile uses TRAA without AO. SSGI and TRAA convergence can only be judged on hardware (REAL_HARDWARE_TODO H5).

## D-010 People navigation and simulation (Phase 3)
- **Navigation: walkable grid generated from the physics colliders, not a Recast navmesh (for now).** `tools/build_nav.ts` flood-fills a 0.5 m grid over the plain W of the Grand Stair and the whole Terrace. A neighbour cell is walkable when it is within one step (0.42 m) and two clearance rays (0.6 m and 1.6 m above the ground) hit nothing. The grid is then eroded by one cell. It runs in 4 s, and a test fails if the grid is older than the architecture (parts hash). NPCs therefore can never walk through anything the player cannot. A* (8-connected, no corner cutting, with a climb penalty) plus string pulling finds paths; they are cached by 5 m buckets. A Recast/Detour build with crowd steering stays the Phase 5 option once the population and settlement need it.
- **Simulation:** pure TypeScript with no renderer dependency, so it can move into a worker in Phase 5. Every decision draws from `Rng(seed, person:day:decision#)`, so outcomes don't depend on frame rate. Tested: identical for the same step size, and >85 % the same between 2 s and 5 s steps.
- **Time jumps** (a date change, load, or a gap of more than 15 minutes): everyone is placed where their schedule puts them at that time (`jumpTo`), rather than being simulated step by step. This follows the continuity rule in §9.2. The full catch-up simulation is Phase 5.
- **Names:** only attested names (`src/data/names.json`: PF tablets, tier A; the EWB lexicon, tier B). Workers of origins with no attested names in the pool (Ionian, Lydian, most Egyptians) are left **unnamed**, as the tablets often record workers by group. Their out-of-world note says so.
- **Doors cut into the garrison and Treasury enclosures** (`r_doors`, tier C): the garrison's W door faces the masons' yard, and the Treasury's single entrance is at the NE, reached through the garrison court. The Hall of 100 Columns floor (+0.5 m) and the other raised palaces have no stairs yet, so they are not walkable until Phase 4.
- **The stair-head braziers moved** to flank the way to the Gate at x = −33.4. They previously stood in the middle of the upper-flight lane.
## D-011 Minimal speech + crowd-murmur pipeline and language lint (Phase 3)
- **Synthesiser:** a Klatt-type formant synthesiser in TypeScript (src/audio/speech.ts) renders lexicon IPA to PCM, which plays through Web Audio (AudioBuffer → HRTF panner → `voices` channel). No external TTS and no network call. PCM rather than a live node graph so it is measurable in node (tests/speech.test.ts measures formant regions, fricative centroids, stop closures, F0 declination) and can be pre-rendered at build time later. Tier C, placeholder quality until the reviewer rates it (brief §10 acceptance).
- **Swappable:** `VoiceBackend` interface; backends are tried in order, so a `RecordingBackend` (local files only; network URLs refused) or a better TTS replaces the formant voice line by line.
- **Lines:** src/people/speech_lines.ts holds lexicon ids only; English glosses are subtitle-layer data. Missing words → line omitted, gap logged (Q-022 … Q-025). Persians greet in Aramaic because Old Persian has no attested greeting.
- **Murmur:** phonotactics counted from each lexicon (onsets, nuclei, codas, syllables per word); pseudo-words that romanise to a common modern word are rejected; languages without a lexicon use the Aramaic profile, flagged C.
- **Language lint:** tests/language.test.ts (`npm run lint:lang`, part of `lint:all`): speech-line fields classified in/out-of-world, heard IPA scanned against a modern-word list (English, modern Persian/Arabic/Hebrew/European greetings, placeholder words) with an explicit homograph allowlist tied to lexicon entries; carved text must be period script only; text-rendering call sites must be registered. The modern-word check is a heuristic (a curated list, not a full dictionary or phonetic matcher) — logged as a known limit.
## D-012 GI composite (high/ultra) and the SSGI washout (Phase 3, session 2)
- **Root cause of the washout:** in three r186 the SSGI node's own output is the **AO texture** (red-only); GI moved to `getGINode()`. The pipeline read `gi.rgb` = (AO, 0, 0) and `gi.a` = 1, so it added albedo-red × AO to every pixel and applied no occlusion. Mean luminance rose 88 → 161 and the darkest pixel 5 → 55 (HANDOFF item 1).
- **Composite now:** `out = scene − (1 − AO) · skylightDiffuse + albedo · bounce`. `skylightDiffuse = albedo · hemiIrradiance(n) / π` is recomputed in the composite from the hemisphere light's own uniforms, so AO darkens only the skylight (never the sun, whose occlusion is the shadow map) and the one-bounce GI is added once.
- **Sky excluded from SSGI:** a patched copy of the node (`src/render/ssgi.ts`, MIT) skips samples whose depth is the clear value (the sky writes no depth, D-007), so the sky is neither an occluder nor a light source (skylight is the analytic hemisphere light; counting sky pixels again would double it). The centre-pixel sky test is reversed-Z aware.
- **GI scale π/2 (C):** with uniform sectors weighted by the receiver cosine, a surface fully enclosed by radiance L accumulates 2L/π per slice, while a Lambert surface under that enclosure reflects albedo·L. Derivation only; judged on hardware (REAL_HARDWARE_TODO H5).
- Alternatives: three's `builtinGIContext` with a pre-pass (GI applied inside the materials) needs a second scene render or last-frame GI; rejected for cost. Keeping the example's `col·AO + albedo·GI` would darken sunlit crevices by AO and double the skylight.
## D-013 Phase 4 access geometry applied (session 2)
- `research/_phase4_spec_patch.json` applied to `site_spec.json` by `tools/apply_phase4_patch.py` (idempotent). Colliding keys renamed (`portico` → `portico_layout` for the Hadish and Harem); new source keys added to `sources.json`.
- **Generator changes** (`src/arch/terrace.ts`; polygon booleans via polygon-clipping, MIT, `src/arch/poly.ts`):
  - **Tachara:** platform stops at the building front (y −99.2); S stair = two flights of 26 × 0.10 m rising to a central landing, outer parapet; hall centre y −80 (between the S doorway at −88 and the N pair at −72 on REF-PLAN), which gives the N rooms their ~15 m depth; N doorway pair ±6 m.
  - **Hadish:** hall 27 m square at 3.9 m pitch (both plans; replaces the 38 m reconstruction, Q-P4-06). Portico rows y −136.5/−140.5. W and E double-reversed stairs, 4 × 25 × 0.12 m each, cut out of the platform. The upper flights are widened by the 0.3 m the patch left between them and the platform edge, because that slot cut the stair off from the N court. The lane divider is as thick as the gap between the lanes. Doors N pair, S, E, W.
  - **Tripylon:** hall 15.46 m; doorways N/E/S only. The platform gains the N portico and stair-head terrace, the S court and the E corridor. N stair 2 × 26 × 0.10 m; small S stair (C); narrow E stair of 20 risers. It **starts at the court (0), not 0.5**: the proposed foot level has no source and no passage floor is modelled, so the riser is 0.13.
  - **Hall of 100 Columns:** eight doorways at ±12.5 m on the aisles. N portico floor to y 27 between anta towers, plus a 3-step band down to the forecourt (C). Portico column rows at ¼ and ¾ of its depth. 3-step thresholds outside the W, E and S doors (C).
  - **Treasury:** N wall at y −78 (both plans), which reopens the street S of the Hall of 100 Columns; doorways N (206.6, −78) and E (217.5, −134.5).
  - **Harem:** enclosure = traced outline ∪ main wing extent (N to y −73). Main hall 16.5 × 16 m with 4 doorways, walls and a roof; 8-column portico. Entrances N (from the passage) and W, each with 7 low steps down from the 1.0 m floor (C).
  - **Not built** (logged, PROGRESS): the Hadish balcony stairs to the Harem (existence B, geometry unknown); the Harem portico step band (court and portico share the wing floor); the Tachara's unidentified third small stair (Q-P4-03).
- **Plan overlay:** the five corrected outlines are compared with the OSM trace plus the documented correction (the test prints each reason). Tachara and Hall 100 are still compared with the plain trace.
- **Walkable grid (D-010 addendum):** erosion is now 4-neighbour. A kept cell centre stays ≥ 0.35 m from anything blocking a neighbour, which is more than the 0.25 m body radius. 8-neighbour erosion (≥ 0.5 m) sealed real ~1.2 m gaps, such as the one between the Tachara S doorway and the first hall column on the axis.
## D-014 Surfaces (session 2): wall paint, floors, court fill, seasonal ground; literal lint fixed
- **Mud-brick walls:** mud plaster with a greyish yellow-green clay paint, attested at Pasargadae and, per Schmidt, on the Treasury walls (Stein et al. 2016, search extract): B for the coating, C for tone and extent (Q-028). Previously a warm brown (C).
- **Floors:** red lime-plaster finish (global.interior_floor) now also in the Tachara hall (B: the flooring-plaster study names the Tachara), the Treasury enclosure (B) and the Hadish, Tripylon and Harem halls (C).
- **Open courts:** no source for their surface (Q-027). Compacted fill with limestone chips (`court_fill`, C) on the Terrace platform top and the garrison/Harem enclosures; the platform's retaining walls stay ashlar.
- **Plain:** loam with stones and a seasonal herb layer. `src/world/season.ts` keys green/dry to the solar day of year, from the winter-rain/dry-summer regime (C).
- **Relief in shading:** each surface has a procedural height field that perturbs the normal (surface gradient from screen-space derivatives): trowelled plaster, sunk ashlar joints, raised chips, herbs. The geometry is unchanged.
- **Literal lint repaired:** its string stripping paired quotes wrongly (a double-quoted string containing apostrophes flipped inside/outside), which had hidden literals since Phase 2: −35 (Grand Stair recess test), 0.03/0.06 (Gate frieze), 0.01 (floor finish), dw/4. Those are now spec rows or derived values (`global.r_floor_finish`, `gate_nations.r_frieze.thickness/offset`, the E lane centreline). The lint now tokenises strings left to right.
- **Garrison W door** moved from y 22.5 to 32 (C): the Hall of 100 Columns portico and its E anta tower (REF-PLAN) now occupy y 8.3–27 there. The tower is clipped at the garrison's traced W edge.
## D-015 Door frames, fires and acoustics beyond the slice (Phase 4, session 2)
- **Stone door frames** (`global.r_door_frame`, C sizes): jambs lining the opening, a lintel and a projecting cornice block (the cavetto cornice: NOT SEEN, verify) at the Apadana, Tachara, Hadish, Tripylon, Hall of 100 Columns and Harem doorways; polished stone (`limestone_dark`). In the two unfinished buildings the frames stand complete above the low walls, since stone was set before brick (C). The Gate keeps its colossi and frieze without frames.
- **Fires** (all C placements): torches on the Tachara, Hadish and Harem hall walls; portico braziers midway between columns; a cooking hearth in the Harem court; torches at the Treasury N doorway. Positions are derived from the spec and manifest rows.
- **Acoustics:** each roofed hall's measured box is recorded in the manifest (`room`), and the world registers one Sabine space per hall (absorption `ROOM_ALPHA`, C). Previously only the Apadana and the Gate had literal dimensions.
- **D-012 addendum (session 2, the high-quality boot hang):** the first high-quality frame locked the main thread and crashed the page after ~120 s. Bisected with `?trace` boot markers and `?post=` variants: any runtime `select()` in the composite hung the node build, whether on the depth texture or on the debug uniform. That composite is the input TRAA renders to a texture. Root cause inside three not isolated; recorded as a limit. Fix: sky pixels now leave the patched SSGI with AO 1 and GI 0, so the composite needs no sky test. The debug views (`?post=scene|ao|gi|plain`) are chosen when the pipeline is built.
## D-016 Human bodies from MakeHuman CC0 assets (session 3; pipeline built, runtime NOT yet switched)
- **Technique:** `tools/build_humans.ts` downloads MakeHuman's CC0 data (base mesh hm08, macro + face targets, default rig + weights, eye proxies and brown eye texture; MPFB2's game-engine rig + weights and base-mesh vertex groups) into `data/makehuman/` (ignored) and derives `public/generated/humans/` (3.0 MB: humans.bin 2.59 MB, humans.json, skin.png, hair.png, eye.png). Only data formats are read (OBJ, .target, MHCLO, rig/weight JSON); no MakeHuman/MPFB program code is used (AGPL/GPL).
- **Skeleton (59 bones, `src/people/humanFormat.ts`):** MakeHuman's game-engine rig minus its ground bone, plus jaw, eyes and four eyelids from the default rig, so faces can talk, blink and look. Weights: game-engine weights everywhere; each vertex's head weight is split among head/jaw/eyes/lids by the default rig's face weights (bones mapped to their nearest face-bone ancestor); top-4, normalised, bytes summing to 255 (tested).
- **Bodies:** 23 variants (15 men 20–62 y, 5 women 22–52 y, 3 children 8–10 y) from the macro targets plus a seeded set of 15 face modifiers each. MakeHuman's three population morphs are blended only as a source of variety and are labelled "variant" in data and overlay, never as an ethnic claim (C). Men's height macro is lowered by 0.10 (period statures below modern defaults, C; morphed heights 1.50–1.79 m); the runtime will still scale to each person's stature.
- **Bind pose:** re-posed at build time by LBS from MakeHuman's A-pose (upper arm 40° from vertical) to arms hanging (6° abduction, elbows 10° flexed, palms toward the thighs) and ankles under the hips; bones keep identity orientation so `anim.ts` conventions (+Z forward, +X left) hold.
- **LODs:** index-only simplification (meshoptimizer, MIT) on the reference body, shared by all variants: full 29,804 tris (body 26,756 + lashes + mouth + high-poly eyes), mid 5,372, far 1,272 (low-poly eyes). Impostors beyond ~150 m are planned, not built.
- **Skin (C):** MakeHuman's skin textures, proxies, eyebrows, eyelashes and hair live in its separate asset repository (makehuman-assets), which the sandbox cannot reach (403/404). The skin albedo is baked in UV space from 3-D procedural functions on the reference body (mottling, pores, lips with cupid's bow, cheek/nose/ear redness, lids, palms/soles, nails, knuckles), with eyebrow density in alpha and beard/scalp/cavity masks in hair.png; cavity occlusion is ray-cast (≤ 3.5 cm) per vertex.
- **Alternatives considered:** MakeHuman's own skins/proxies/hair (CC0 but unreachable); hand-modelled heads (no likeness data, slower); keeping the procedural rigs (the rubric's weakest area).
- **NOT DONE (honest status):** the runtime still renders the PLACEHOLDER rigs (`src/people/body.ts`, `crowd.ts`, `player/body.ts` unchanged). Not yet written: the runtime loader/geometry assembly, garments (coverage + inflation of body regions, skirt tubes, sleeves, belts), hair/beard shells and volumes (Persian nape bun, long curled beard), hats (fluted hat, soft cap, band, veil), the TSL human material (wrap-lighting SSS approximation, per-object colours via userData), the animation retarget to the 59-bone skeleton (face: jaw/blink/eye look-at; finger curl axes are already in the asset), crowd/player integration, the per-frame CPU budget test and the in-engine close-up renders. Cloth simulation is not planned (garments will follow the skeleton).
